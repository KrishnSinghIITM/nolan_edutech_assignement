20,P20_REV_013,Narayan Tripathy,5,Classy product,Best compact flagship phone❤️❤️. The camera is outstanding and the dynamic range is pretty good. Top notch performance with SD 8 gen 3 and awesome display. Played BGMI and Genshin Impact and it handled smoothly. Design also looks premium and One UI is highly optimised📱. Only issue with small battery size. It could have been better.READ MORE,Bhadrak,1 month ago,1,Yes
