69,P69_REV_007,Dipsy Shah,1,Did not meet expectations,Battery is worst. It is draining too fast At night if battery is 30% morning the phone is switched off. Not happy with the battery at all And when given to service centre in warranty period which is till 5th nov i received the phone on 5th nov they said the phone is activated on 26th oct I had ordered from flipkart. So flipkart is also scamming with the clients. So need a solution to this flipkart. Don't buy this product and don't buy from flipkartREAD MORE,Konkan Division,24 days ago,2,Yes
