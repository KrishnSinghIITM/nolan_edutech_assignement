8,P8_REV_010,junayed  Alam,5,Wonderful,"I have been using the Galaxy S24 for some time now and I am really happy with it. The phone feels very premium in hand and the display is bright, smooth and perfect for watching videos. Performance is super fast, apps open instantly and everything runs buttery smooth.Battery life is solid too. I am a light user with no gaming and I usually get around 7 hours of screen on time, which easily lasts me the whole day. The cameras are excellent, sharp photos and natural colors even in low light....READ MORE",Maldah District,1 month ago,2,Yes

8,P8_REV_013,Pravin Sharma,5,Awesome,Its a good phone with amazing features but if you want to have great battery performance than think twice cause its battery performance is bit low.
