11,P11_REV_012,Nirmal Bothra,5,Must buy!,Using this phone for one week now. Overall a decent choice if your not into gaming (go for 13R).. BUILD and Design is excellent. In hand feel is too good. Comparing to 13R this one is too comfortable to use and carry everyday. It does gets warm quickly even in smaller task if your connected to 4g or 5g. In case of wifi its does gets warm but after 20 min.Camera is great for the price.. no network issues so far( im using jio). Performance is best for the price. Battery i would say decent...READ MORE,Erode,1 month ago,2,Yes
