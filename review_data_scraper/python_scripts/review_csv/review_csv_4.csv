4,P4_REV_013,Prashantha S,5,Brilliant,"Since thousands of reviews have been written on this phone, it seems unnecessary for me to delve deeper into the details. It's a wonderful compact phone with great design, wonderful display and unmatched UI. Only area it is lacking in is battery and camera hardware. Samsung has to work seriously on these two aspects.

4,P4_REV_016,Krishnajith P S,5,Great product,"The form factor, the size, the weight, its awsome. It always feels like a precious piece of jewelry ✨️. Especially in this particular color the bezels feels lot thinner.The software is extremely optimized. One UI is a bliss.
