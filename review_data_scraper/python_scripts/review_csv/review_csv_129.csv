129,P129_REV_016,Hemant  Chaudhary,4,Good quality product,I loved the design and look of this phone. The battery is a little of a problem and sometimes the phone feels warm. The camera slightly struggles in a dark ambience. Smoothness and user experience is top notch.READ MORE,Mathura,1 month ago,0,Yes
