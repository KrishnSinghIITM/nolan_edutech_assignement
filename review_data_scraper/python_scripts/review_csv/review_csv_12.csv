12,P12_REV_012,Sayyed  Gouse,5,Perfect product!,Great compact and light weight phone. The edges are not rounded hence while holding the phone bare will feel uncomfortable. But getting a good case solves that. Battery is decent and not recommended for heavy users. Charging takes about 45min to 1 hour to go from 10 to 85%. Display and touch is awesome as expected from Samsung. Camera is good if not great (I used to have pixel earlier so feeling it). User interface and features are great as well. overall an amazing deal at 38.5k.READ MORE,Hyderabad,11 days ago,1,Yes

12,P12_REV_014,Abhishek singh,5,Highly recommended,"Coming from samsung M34, this feels awesome to use. Performance even in light profile is super good. Adreno750 gpu can run most games in playstore. Heavy usage will drain battery life similar to a powerful gaming laptop. However, Light, mixed usage will get you by one day.The design and size is super sexy. As of November 2025, S25 has better SoC but this S24 is super value for money, you're are getting 95% of S25.READ MORE",Ahmedabad,13 days ago,1,Yes
